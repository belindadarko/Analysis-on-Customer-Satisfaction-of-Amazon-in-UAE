# Analysis-on-Customer-Satisfaction-of-Amazon-in-UAE

This is a data analysis on customer satisfaction & demographics in purchases at Amazon in UAE.
Python was first used to clean the data and extracted to Excel.

Detailed regression analysis and final logistic regression model in Excel aided me to create a confusion matrix to determine whether a customer will spend more than 1000 AED per purchase.

The final report on Word shows key insights drawn from the data and recommendations that e-Commerce can follow to increase customer satisfaction in UAE.
